There are two breast cancer datasets in this track: BC-TCGA and GSE2034. BC-TCGA contains 48 normal tissue samples and 422 breast cancer tissue samples (sample per column). Each sample has 17,814 genes (gene per row). GSE2034 contains 142 recurrence tumor samples and 83 no recurrence normal samples (sample per column), where each of the individual has 12,634 genes (gene per row).

Each data file contains either normal tissue samples or breast cancer tissue samples. The first column indicates gene index, and the second column shows the reference gene expression value. The sample gene expression data starts from the third column with the first row displaying the sample id.
